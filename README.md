  * Using microeconomics to analyze and resolve real-world policy and business problems
 
  * A market-leading text, Microeconomics presents economic theory in the context of real, data-driven examples, and then develops your intuition through hallmark Solved Problems. The text places emphasis on modern theories--such as industrial organization theory, game theory, and transaction cost theory--that are useful in analyzing actual markets, while a step-by-step problem-based learning approach demonstrates how to use microeconomic theory to solve business problems and analyze policy. The 8th Edition has been substantially updated with new or revised real-world examples, applications, and problems so that you gain a practical perspective, seeing how models connect to real-¿world decisions being made in today’s firms and policy debates.
